<p id='bio'>hi, i'm aaron and i'm a designer based out of boston, ma.<br>
  my background is largely in music, but my exploration of music notation led me to design.<br>
  it's as a musician that i learned empathy, and this empathy informs my ux research.
  <br>
  it's as a user that i've learned design, and this desire to see what's out there
  keeps me fresh. </p>
